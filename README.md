# Ya-Hussein-Coin-
Cryptocurrency for the shiaa Community 
# Project Name: Ya Hussein Coin 
## Abstract
Our digital flag aims to be the unified currency of the Shiite community later on, 
of course it can be used by anyone who owns it, but basically this currency was created to be valuable among the members of the Shiaa community itself,
who believe in the line of Hussein, peace be upon him. 
This currency will be used as a first stage in the Shiite community store on our website,
and a number of them will be distributed on our Telegram page, 
and assistants, supervisors and anyone who provides any service to our pages on social media or on our website will be given in exchange for this digital currency. 
We aspire later to inject liquidity into this currency and introduce it to the digital currency market,
and of course we will always try to develop the project and the currency.

## Introduction
We have to admit that the time we live in is the digital time, 
and we also have to admit that we as a Shiaa community are very late in the technological and digital development that is happening around us,
and the reason for this delay is our lack of confidence in using information and communication technology and anything digital on platforms other than ours,
and that is because of their fighting us, so we will of course be exposed to them,
and we cannot remain idle as if we live on an isolated island from this world,
so we decided to start entering into technological and digital development but with our own products and our own efforts,
of course this is only the beginning and the road is long ahead of us.
